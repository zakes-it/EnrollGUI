## Synopsis

Munki Enroll GUI is a graphic tool for enrolling clients in Munki inspired by Munki Enroll (https://github.com/edingc/munki-enroll).

## Installation

Munki Enroll GUI requires a working MWA2 server and requires munki to be installed on the client computer it us run from.

You will also need to organize your munki repo manifest directory to include a folder for client manifests and one or more folders for software manifests.
